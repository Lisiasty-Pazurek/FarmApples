# Introduction

The Project is going to be used for educational purposes for a PhD thesis that focuses on studying the impact of multiplayer games in developing social skills. To make a safe environment for early school students, custom-made game have to be developed. Pre and post-test questionnaires will be used as the main research tool. Additional documentation may include video recordings or logs. About 20 students will take part in the research at a certain time.
